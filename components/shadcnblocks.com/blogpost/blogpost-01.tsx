          <p className="text-muted-foreground mt-2 text-lg">
            In a kingdom far away, where laughter once flowed freely, a peculiar
            tale unfolded about a king who decided to tax the very essence of
            joy itself - jokes and jest.
          </p>

          <h2>How the Tax System Works</h2>
          <p>
            The king, seeing how much happier his subjects were, realized the
            error of his ways and repealed the joke tax. Jokester was declared a
            hero, and the kingdom lived happily ever after.

            <AlertDescription>
              Remember, all jokes must be registered at the Royal Jest Office
              before telling them

          </Alert>
          <h2>The People&apos;s Rebellion</h2>
          <p>
            The people of the kingdom, feeling uplifted by the laughter, started
            to tell jokes and puns again, and soon the entire kingdom was in on
            the joke.
          </p>

          </div>
          <p>
            The king, seeing how much happier his subjects were, realized the
            error of his ways and repealed the joke tax. Jokester was declared a
            hero, and the kingdom lived happily ever after.

          <h2>The King&apos;s Plan</h2>

          <img
            src="https://deifkwefumgah.cloudfront.net/shadcnblocks/block/placeholder-1.svg"
            alt="placeholder"
            className="my-8 aspect-video w-full rounded-md object-cover"
          />
          <p>
            The king thought long and hard, and finally came up with{" "}
            <a href="#">a brilliant plan</a>: he would tax the jokes in the
            kingdom.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;everyone enjoys a good
            joke, so it&apos;s only fair that they should pay for the
            privilege.&rdquo;
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            The king&apos;s subjects were not amused. They grumbled and
            complained, but the king was firm:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>1st level of puns: 5 gold coins</li>
            <li>2nd level of jokes: 10 gold coins</li>
            <li>3rd level of one-liners : 20 gold coins</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            As a result, people stopped telling jokes, and the kingdom fell into
            a gloom. But there was one person who refused to let the king&apos;s
            foolishness get him down: a court jester named Jokester.
